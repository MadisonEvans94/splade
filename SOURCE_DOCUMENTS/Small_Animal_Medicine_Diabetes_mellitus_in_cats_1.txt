Diabetes mellitus is a common endocrine disorder that affects cats, just as it does humans. It is important for veterinary professionals to have a thorough understanding of this condition in order to properly diagnose and manage affected feline patients. This document will provide an overview of diabetes mellitus in cats, including its causes, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

Causes:
Diabetes mellitus in cats is primarily classified into two types: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by an absolute deficiency of insulin, often due to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. This type is less common in cats. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is more prevalent and is typically caused by insulin resistance. Risk factors for the development of diabetes in cats include obesity, genetics, age (more common in older cats), and certain medical conditions such as pancreatitis.

Clinical Signs:
The clinical signs of diabetes mellitus in cats can vary, but common symptoms include increased thirst (polydipsia), increased urination (polyuria), weight loss despite a good appetite, lethargy, and unkempt fur. Some cats may also develop secondary complications such as urinary tract infections or neuropathy. It is important for veterinary professionals to recognize these clinical signs and perform diagnostic tests to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

Diagnosis:
Diagnosing diabetes mellitus in cats typically involves a combination of clinical signs, physical examination findings, and laboratory tests. Blood and urine tests are essential for confirming the diagnosis. Blood glucose levels are often elevated in diabetic cats, and glucose may also be present in the urine. Additional tests such as fructosamine levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) can help assess long-term glucose control in diabetic cats. In some cases, further testing such as an oral glucose tolerance test may be necessary to differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

Treatment:
The primary goal of treatment for diabetes mellitus in cats is to regulate blood glucose levels and manage clinical signs. This typically involves a combination of insulin therapy, diet modification, and weight management. Insulin therapy is usually administered by subcutaneous injection, and the type and dose of insulin may vary depending on the individual cat's needs. It is important for owners to be educated on how to properly administer insulin and monitor their cat's glucose levels at home. Dietary management is also crucial, with a focus on feeding a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet to help regulate blood glucose levels. Weight management through portion control and regular exercise is also important in managing diabetes in cats.

Prognosis:
With proper management, many diabetic cats can lead a good quality of life. However, diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment and monitoring. Regular veterinary check-ups, blood glucose monitoring, and adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary to ensure optimal control of the disease. Complications such as hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis can occur if the condition is not properly managed. In some cases, diabetic remission may occur, especially in cats with Type 2 diabetes that are diagnosed and treated early. It is important for veterinary professionals to work closely with owners to develop an individualized treatment plan for each diabetic cat to improve their long-term prognosis.

In conclusion, diabetes mellitus is a common endocrine disorder in cats that requires careful management to ensure the best possible outcome for affected patients. Veterinary professionals play a crucial role in diagnosing, treating, and monitoring diabetic cats to help them live a healthy and happy life. By understanding the causes, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diabetes mellitus in cats, veterinarians can provide comprehensive care for feline patients with this condition.
