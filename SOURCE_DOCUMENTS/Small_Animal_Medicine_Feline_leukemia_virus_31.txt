Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a significant infectious disease affecting domestic cats worldwide. FeLV is a retrovirus that can lead to various health problems in infected cats, including anemia, immunosuppression, and various types of cancer. Understanding the transmission, clinical signs, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of FeLV is essential for veterinary professionals to effectively manage infected cats and prevent the spread of the virus.

Transmission of FeLV primarily occurs through close contact between cats. The virus can be spread through saliva, nasal secretions, urine, feces, and milk. Cats are most commonly infected through mutual grooming, bite wounds, and sharing food and water bowls. Kittens can also become infected in utero or through nursing from an infected queen. FeLV is not highly contagious, but the virus can persist in the environment for a limited time, making it important to thoroughly clean and disinfect areas where infected cats have been.

Clinical signs of FeLV infection can vary widely and may include lethargy, weight loss, poor coat condition, fever, anemia, jaundice, and recurring infections. Some cats may develop cancerous conditions such as lymphoma or leukemia. FeLV can also lead to immunosuppression, making infected cats more susceptible to other infections and diseases. Testing for FeLV should be considered in cats with compatible clinical signs or those at high risk of exposure to the virus.

Diagnosing FeLV infection typically involves a combination of blood tests. The most common test is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, which detects viral antigens in the blood. Cats that test positive on the ELISA test should have the result confirmed with a follow-up test, such as an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. It is important to note that some cats may be able to clear the virus on their own, so retesting may be necessary in some cases.

Preventing FeLV infection is critical in managing the disease. Vaccination is available to help protect cats from FeLV, especially those at high risk of exposure, such as outdoor cats or cats living in multi-cat households. Vaccination is typically recommended for kittens and cats that are negative for FeLV. Additionally, preventing exposure to infected cats and minimizing stress can help reduce the risk of FeLV transmission.

Treatment options for FeLV are primarily focused on supportive care and managing secondary conditions. There is no cure for FeLV, so treatment aims to improve the quality of life for infected cats and manage any associated health issues. Supportive care may include fluid therapy, nutritional support, and medications to treat symptoms such as anemia or infections. Regular veterinary check-ups and monitoring are essential for managing FeLV-infected cats.

In conclusion, feline leukemia virus is a significant infectious disease that can have serious health implications for infected cats. Understanding the transmission, clinical signs, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of FeLV is crucial for veterinary professionals to provide optimal care for infected cats and prevent the spread of the virus. By implementing appropriate preventive measures and early detection strategies, veterinarians can help protect the health and well-being of their feline patients.
