Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that infects domestic cats worldwide. It is a leading cause of illness and death in cats, particularly those that spend time outdoors or live in multi-cat households. FeLV can affect cats of all ages, but kittens and young cats are more susceptible to infection due to their immature immune systems.

FeLV is primarily transmitted through close contact with an infected cat. This can occur through mutual grooming, sharing food and water bowls, or through bite wounds. FeLV can also be transmitted from an infected mother cat to her kittens during pregnancy or through nursing. The virus is not highly contagious and does not survive for long outside the cat's body, so casual contact is unlikely to result in transmission.

Once a cat is infected with FeLV, the virus attacks the immune system, leading to a wide range of symptoms and complications. Some cats may initially show no signs of illness, while others may develop symptoms such as lethargy, weight loss, anemia, and recurrent infections. FeLV can also predispose cats to certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma.

Diagnosing FeLV involves testing a cat's blood for the presence of the virus. There are two main types of tests used for FeLV screening: ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and IFA (indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay). ELISA tests are commonly used as they are quick and easy to perform, while IFA tests are more sensitive and are often used to confirm positive ELISA results.

There is no cure for FeLV, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing secondary infections. Supportive care, such as fluid therapy and nutritional support, may be necessary for cats with severe symptoms. Cats with FeLV should be kept indoors to reduce their risk of exposure to other infections and to prevent them from spreading the virus to other cats.

Preventing FeLV infection is key to protecting cats from this deadly virus. Vaccination is an important tool in preventing FeLV, particularly for cats that spend time outdoors or are at risk of exposure to infected cats. The FeLV vaccine is usually recommended for kittens and young cats, as well as for adult cats with an unknown vaccination history.

In multi-cat households, it is important to test all cats for FeLV before introducing a new cat to the household. FeLV-positive cats should be kept separate from FeLV-negative cats to prevent transmission. Regular testing and vaccination can help control the spread of FeLV in multi-cat environments.

Overall, FeLV is a serious and potentially fatal disease that can have devastating consequences for infected cats. Understanding the risk factors for FeLV transmission and taking steps to prevent infection are essential for protecting the health and well-being of cats, particularly those at higher risk of exposure. Veterinary professionals play a crucial role in educating cat owners about FeLV and helping them make informed decisions about vaccination and testing for this deadly virus.
