Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that infects domestic cats worldwide. It is a significant cause of illness and death in domestic cats, particularly those that spend time outdoors or live in multi-cat households. FeLV affects the immune system, leading to immunosuppression and making infected cats more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. FeLV can also cause certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma.

Transmission of FeLV occurs primarily through close contact with infected cats. The virus is shed in saliva, nasal secretions, urine, and feces of infected cats. FeLV is most commonly spread through mutual grooming, sharing food and water bowls, and through bite wounds during fights. Kittens can also become infected in utero or through nursing from an infected mother.

There are three stages of FeLV infection: primary viremia, where the virus enters the bloodstream and replicates in white blood cells; secondary viremia, where the virus spreads to other tissues and organs; and the latent stage, where the virus becomes dormant in the bone marrow or other tissues. During the latent stage, infected cats may show no clinical signs but can still spread the virus to other cats.

Clinical signs of FeLV infection can vary widely and may include lethargy, weight loss, decreased appetite, fever, pale gums, respiratory infections, diarrhea, and lymphadenopathy. FeLV-infected cats are also at increased risk of developing certain cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia. Diagnosis of FeLV is typically done through blood tests that detect viral proteins or genetic material.

There is currently no cure for FeLV, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications. Supportive care such as fluid therapy, nutritional support, and antibiotics to treat secondary infections can help improve the quality of life for infected cats. Regular veterinary check-ups are essential for monitoring the progression of the disease and managing any complications that arise.

Prevention is key in controlling the spread of FeLV. Vaccination is available to help protect uninfected cats from contracting the virus. The FeLV vaccine is recommended for all kittens and indoor-outdoor cats that may be at risk of exposure. Testing for FeLV is also an important part of preventive care, especially for new cats entering a household or sick cats with unknown FeLV status.

In multi-cat households or environments where FeLV is prevalent, it is essential to practice good hygiene and to separate FeLV-positive cats from FeLV-negative cats to prevent transmission. FeLV-positive cats should be kept indoors to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to other cats in the community.

In conclusion, Feline leukemia virus is a significant health concern for domestic cats, particularly those that spend time outdoors or live in multi-cat households. Understanding the transmission, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of FeLV is essential for veterinary professionals to effectively manage infected cats and prevent the spread of the virus within the feline population. By promoting vaccination, regular testing, and good hygiene practices, veterinary professionals can help reduce the impact of FeLV on the health and well-being of domestic cats in North America.
