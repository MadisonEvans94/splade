Neoplasms, also known as tumors, are abnormal growths of tissue in animals. In dogs, neoplasms are relatively common and can be benign or malignant. It is important for veterinarians to be able to recognize and diagnose common neoplasms in dogs in order to provide appropriate treatment and care. The following is a list of some common neoplasms seen in dogs on the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE):

1. Mast Cell Tumors: Mast cell tumors are one of the most common skin tumors in dogs. They arise from a type of white blood cell called mast cells and can vary in appearance from small, raised lumps to larger, ulcerated masses. Mast cell tumors can be benign or malignant, and the grade of the tumor is important in determining the prognosis and treatment options for the dog.

2. Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that is commonly seen in large and giant breed dogs. It typically affects the long bones of the limbs, such as the radius, ulna, and femur. Osteosarcoma is an aggressive cancer that can metastasize to other parts of the body, most commonly the lungs. Treatment usually involves amputation of the affected limb followed by chemotherapy to help control metastasis.

3. Hemangiosarcoma: Hemangiosarcoma is a malignant cancer of the blood vessels that is commonly seen in dogs, especially breeds such as German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers. Hemangiosarcoma can affect the spleen, liver, or heart, and is often diagnosed when the tumor ruptures, causing internal bleeding. Prognosis for dogs with hemangiosarcoma is poor, as the cancer is highly aggressive and difficult to treat.

4. Lymphoma: Lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates in the lymphoid tissues and can affect various organs in the body, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. Lymphoma is one of the most common cancers seen in dogs, and can present with symptoms such as enlarged lymph nodes, weight loss, and lethargy. Treatment for lymphoma typically involves chemotherapy, which can help to induce remission and improve the dog's quality of life.

5. Mammary Gland Tumors: Mammary gland tumors are common in female dogs that have not been spayed. These tumors can be benign or malignant, and early detection is key to successful treatment. Mammary gland tumors are often surgically removed, and spaying the dog can help to prevent the development of future tumors.

6. Melanoma: Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in the skin. Melanoma can be benign or malignant, and can occur in areas with pigmented skin such as the mouth, eyes, and paw pads. Treatment for melanoma may involve surgical removal of the tumor, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy depending on the location and stage of the cancer.

7. Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that commonly affects the ears, nose, and mouth of dogs. This type of cancer is often associated with sun exposure and is more common in dogs with light-colored fur. Treatment for squamous cell carcinoma may involve surgical removal of the tumor, radiation therapy, or cryotherapy.

In conclusion, neoplasms are a common finding in dogs and can vary in their presentation, behavior, and treatment options. Veterinarians should be familiar with the common neoplasms seen in dogs in order to provide timely and appropriate care for their patients. Diagnosing and treating neoplasms in dogs requires a thorough physical examination, diagnostic testing, and collaboration with veterinary oncologists to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.
