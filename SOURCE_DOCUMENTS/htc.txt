HTC One is a series of Android and Windows Phone smartphones designed and manufactured by HTC. All products in the One series were designed to be touchscreen-based and slate-sized, and to initially run the Android mobile operating system (Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich or subsequent Android releases) with the HTC Sense graphical user interface. The one exception to this is the HTC One (M8), which also had a Windows Phone variant. From 2010 to 2013, all HTC products starting from the HTC Sensation XE to the HTC One Mini were equipped with a Beats Audio equalizer. Later HTC devices beginning with the HTC One Max no longer ship with Beats Audio following the buyback of HTC's stake in Beats Electronics.

2012 lineup
While critically acclaimed, the 2012 One series had not received much consumer attention and sales were disappointing. For one, HTC has been outspent on marketing by Samsung and Apple, as HTC instead had relied heavily on carriers to promote its products.[1] Also, while HTC made many carrier-specific devices, Samsung and Apple were able to concentrate their resources on single flagship handsets such as the Samsung Galaxy S III and iPhone 4S to attract the attention of the consumers. Lastly, while HTC handsets were seen as better quality than Samsung's plastic devices, Samsung was able to successfully distinguish itself from other Android manufacturers with manufacturer-specific software tweaks (as well as marketing to promote its brand) while HTC could not.[2]

The "One" devices released in 2012 consist of the following, with devices in similar price segments usually sold by different carriers:

HTC One V, a low-end smartphone
HTC One S, a mid-range smartphone
The Japanese variant, HTC J, many of the same specifications as the One S, but has a larger battery and runs on WiMAX
HTC One X, a high-end smartphone
An LTE variant of the HTC One X with the same name is sold in North America, with a 1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 MSM8960 processor instead of the quad core Nvidia Tegra
HTC One X+ a refresh of the One X which has a faster clocked Tegra 3 processor, larger battery and more memory than the HTC One X
HTC Evo 4G LTE, a North American variant similar to the LTE One X, but with added features including a MicroSD slot and kickstand, exclusive to Sprint Nextel
2013 lineup
The 2013 One series was reduced to focus on only three versions of one main design. Three devices had been announced as of October 2013: the HTC One (M7) in February 2013, the One Mini in July 2013, and the One Max in October 2013. Following the previous year's setbacks, the HTC One was critically acclaimed for its design, and was commercially successful.
