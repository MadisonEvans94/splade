Common neoplasms in dogs are a significant concern for veterinarians and pet owners alike. Neoplasms, also known as tumors, can be either benign or malignant, and they can arise in various tissues throughout a dog's body. Understanding the common neoplasms in dogs is crucial for early detection, proper diagnosis, and appropriate treatment. This document will provide an overview of some of the most common neoplasms seen in dogs, focusing on those that are frequently tested on the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE).

1. Mast Cell Tumors:
Mast cell tumors are one of the most common skin tumors in dogs, accounting for approximately 16-21% of all skin tumors. These tumors arise from mast cells, which are immune cells involved in allergic reactions. Mast cell tumors can vary in appearance and behavior, making them challenging to diagnose and treat. They are commonly found on the trunk, limbs, and perineal region of the dog. Diagnosis is typically made through fine needle aspiration or biopsy, and treatment may involve surgical removal, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

2. Osteosarcoma:
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in dogs, accounting for approximately 85% of all bone tumors. This aggressive tumor typically affects large and giant breeds, such as Great Danes, Saint Bernards, and Rottweilers. Osteosarcoma most commonly occurs in the long bones of the limbs, leading to lameness and swelling. Diagnosis is usually confirmed through radiographs and biopsy. Treatment often involves amputation of the affected limb followed by chemotherapy to address potential metastasis to the lungs.

3. Lymphoma:
Lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in dogs, accounting for approximately 7-24% of all canine tumors. This cancer arises from lymphocytes, which are immune cells found in lymphoid tissues throughout the body. Lymphoma can manifest in various forms, including multicentric, alimentary, mediastinal, and cutaneous. Clinical signs may include enlarged lymph nodes, weight loss, lethargy, and anorexia. Diagnosis is typically made through fine needle aspiration of affected lymph nodes or biopsy. Treatment options for lymphoma may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy.

4. Mammary Tumors:
Mammary tumors are common in female dogs, with an estimated incidence of 50% in unspayed females over the age of seven. These tumors can be benign or malignant, and they often present as firm, painless masses in the mammary glands. Early spaying reduces the risk of developing mammary tumors in female dogs. Diagnosis is typically made through fine needle aspiration or biopsy. Treatment involves surgical removal of the affected mammary glands, along with potential chemotherapy or radiation therapy for malignant tumors.

5. Hemangiosarcoma:
Hemangiosarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer that arises from the cells lining blood vessels. This tumor commonly affects the spleen, heart, and liver in dogs. Hemangiosarcoma is often asymptomatic until it reaches an advanced stage, leading to sudden collapse or internal bleeding. Diagnosis is challenging and may involve imaging studies, such as ultrasound or radiographs, along with fine needle aspiration or biopsy. Treatment options for hemangiosarcoma may include surgery, chemotherapy, and supportive care.

In conclusion, understanding the common neoplasms in dogs is essential for veterinarians preparing for the NAVLE. Early detection, proper diagnosis, and appropriate treatment of neoplasms can significantly impact the prognosis and quality of life for affected dogs. Veterinarians must be knowledgeable about the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and treatment options for common neoplasms in dogs to provide optimal care for their patients.
