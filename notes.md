# Bot:
Ventricular premature contractions(VPCs) are a type of arrhythmia where the heart beats prematurely due to abnormal electrical activity in the ventricles. VPCs can lead to more serious arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, VPCs are a type of arrhythmia that can be a precursor to more dangerous cardiac events.
